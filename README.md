## Description
A notes app made with React. This app uses localStorage to store your notes, similar to my previous to-do app.
Each note used to display with a random background color, but on page reload, the background colors would occasionally be absent from one or more of the notes.

> Code for random background color

## Notes
> This is an ongoing project! The app works as intended, but I really want to figure out the background colors and/or 
> polish the UI. It's more of a project for design now.
